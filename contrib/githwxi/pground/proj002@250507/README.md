# ATS3 co-programming with JavaScript

One can find some examples showing how JS code generated by XATS2JS is
mixed with JS code obtained otherwise (e.g., manually written). The
essential feature needed is the one that allows functions defined in ATS3
to be called in JS and vice versa.

Happy ATS programming!
