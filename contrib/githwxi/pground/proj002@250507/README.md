# ATS3 co-programming with JavaScript

We will see some examples showing how JS code generated by XATS2JS can
be mixed with JS code obtained otherwise (e.g., manually written). The
essential feature we need is the one that allows functions defined in ATS3
to be called in JS and vice versa.

Happy ATS programming!
