# Presenting Streams

[comment]: # HX-2025-05-08: It is ongoing.

Let us build a webpage for presenting the elements in a (lazy) stream.
For instance, we can build a stream of all the prime numbers and
present these primes by clicking a button. One prime is shown after a
clicking and the next prime is shown after the next clicking.

Happy ATS programming!
