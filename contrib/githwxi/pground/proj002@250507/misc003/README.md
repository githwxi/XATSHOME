# Implementing a Counter

Let us build a webpage containing a counter whose count can be
increased and decreased by clicking buttons. Compared to the version
in `misc002`, the count of this counter increases or decreases
continuously.  This kind of behavior is commonly achieved through the
use of a JS function `setTimeout`. For instance, a callback function
can first do some actions and then call `setTimeout` to schedule a
future call to itself.

Happy ATS programming!
