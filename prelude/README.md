# XATSHOME/prelude

This is the place for a big variety of function templates on basic
data types such as char (for 8-bit characters), sint and uint (for
signed and unsigned integers of some fixed precision), sflt and dflt
(for floating point numbers of single and double precision), strn (for
some array-based representation of strings).
